//for loop
//print  number till 0 to 10
//here in for loop the intilization , condition and the increment are specifed inside the condition itself
for (let i = 0; i <=10; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}

// here if initilazation is done outside the loop it will catch an error 
//but we can initilaze both let and var , in this but in real life we don't use it
